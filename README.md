I am a lecturer in the Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) programme at 
Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin, New Zealand. This programme, and my own work 
within it, focuses on teaching students to be well prepared to enter the
IT profession. As such, it contains a bit less theory and a bit more practice than one
might normally expect in a computer science course. In the BIT we 
strive to use current tools and to demonstrate current industry best practices.
In this setting it's natural to use Git and GitHub to manage and share teaching
materials.
