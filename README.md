I am a lecturer in the Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) programme at 
Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin, New Zealand. This programme focuses on teaching
students to be well prepared to enter the
IT profession. As such, it contains a bit less theory and a bit more practice than one
might normally expect in a typical computer science course.  I'm continuing Tom Clark's
practice of using contemporary tools (in this case Git and GitHub) to manage and
share teaching materials.
